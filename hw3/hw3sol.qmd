In this exercise, we use tidyverse (ggplot2, dplyr, etc) to explore the [MIMIC-IV](https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/) data introduced in [homework 1](https://ucla-biostat-203b.github.io/2024winter/hw/hw1/hw1.html) and to build a cohort of ICU stays.

## Q1. Visualizing patient trajectory

Visualizing a patient's encounters in a health care system is a common task in clinical data analysis. In this question, we will visualize a patient's ADT (admission-discharge-transfer) history and ICU vitals in the MIMIC-IV data.

### Q1.1 ADT history

A patient's ADT history records the time of admission, discharge, and transfer in the hospital. This figure shows the ADT history of the patient with `subject_id` 10001217 in the MIMIC-IV data. The x-axis is the calendar time, and the y-axis is the type of event (ADT, lab, procedure). The color of the line segment represents the care unit. The size of the line segment represents whether the care unit is an ICU/CCU. The crosses represent lab events, and the shape of the dots represents the type of procedure. The title of the figure shows the patient's demographic information and the subtitle shows top 3 diagnoses.

![](https://github.com/ucla-biostat-203b/2024winter/blob/main/hw/hw3/10001217_adt.png?raw=true)

Do a similar visualization for the patient with `subject_id` 10013310 using ggplot.

Hint: We need to pull information from data files `patients.csv.gz`, `admissions.csv.gz`, `transfers.csv.gz`, `labevents.csv.gz`, `procedures_icd.csv.gz`, `diagnoses_icd.csv.gz`, `d_icd_procedures.csv.gz`, and `d_icd_diagnoses.csv.gz`. For the big file `labevents.csv.gz`, use the Parquet format you generated in Homework 2. For reproducibility, make the Parquet folder `labevents_pq` available at the current working directory `hw3`, for example, by a symbolic link. Make your code reproducible.

**Answer:** Prepare the data.

```{bash}
## ln -s ~/203b-lecture/203b-hw/hw2/labevents.parquet
##  ~/203b-lecture/203b-hw/hw3/labevents.parquet

```

```{r}

patient_1 <- patients %>% filter(subject_id == 10013310)

```

```{r}
labevents_1 <- arrow::open_dataset("labevents.parquet") %>%
  select(subject_id, charttime) %>%
  filter(subject_id == 10013310) %>%
  collect()
```

**Answer:** `patient_1` and `admissions_1` include the info we need for the 
title, thus we can can tell the title would be "Patient 10013310, F, 
70 years old, black/african"
```{r, eval=FALSE}
print(patient_1, width = Inf)
print(admissions_1, width = Inf)
```

**Answer:** Subtitles need to include top 3 diagnosis. I will take the first
three diagnosis for the first hospital admission. From the `admission_1` table, 
we found that the `hadm_id` for the first admission is 27682188. I will then 
filter for the first three diagnoses based on `seq_num`. 
```{r}
hadm_id_top3 <- diag_icd_1 %>%

top3_diag_names <- top3_diag$long_title
print(top3_diag_names)

### Q1.2 ICU stays

ICU stays are a subset of ADT history. This figure shows the vitals of the patient `10001217` during ICU stays. The x-axis is the calendar time, and the y-axis is the value of the vital. The color of the line represents the type of vital. The facet grid shows the abbreviation of the vital and the stay ID.

![](https://github.com/ucla-biostat-203b/2024winter/blob/main/hw/hw3/10001217_icu.png?raw=true)


Do a similar visualization for the patient `10013310`.

**Answer:** First, we need the data in the vitals for ICU patients, which is
the exercise we did in hw2. Because in hw2, we only have the `itemid` for mean 
non-invasive blood pressure (220181), so I will use NBPm instead of  NBPd.
```{bash}
#| eval: false
cd  ~/mimic/icu
gzip -cd chartevents.csv.gz > ~/203b-lecture/203b-hw/hw3/chartevents.csv

```

```{r}
item_ids_chart <- c(220045, 220181, 220179, 223761, 220210)
icu_vital_1.2 <- open_dataset("chartevents.csv", format = "csv") %>%
  select(subject_id, hadm_id, itemid, charttime, valuenum) %>%
  filter(itemid %in% item_ids_chart, subject_id == 10013310) %>%
  collect()
```

```{r}
item_names <- data.frame(
  itemid = c(220045, 220181, 220179, 223761, 220210),
  item_name = c("HR", "NBPm", "NBPs", "Temperature", "RR"))

icu_vital_1.2 <- icu_vital_1.2 %>%
  left_join(item_names, by = "itemid")

```

```{r}
ggplot(data = icu_vital_1.2, aes(x = charttime, y = valuenum, group = hadm_id, 
  color = item_name)) +
  geom_line() +
  facet_grid(item_name ~ hadm_id, scales = "free", space = "fixed") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Patient 10013310 ICU stays - Vitals", 
  x = "Calendar Time", 
  y = "Value") +
  theme_minimal() +  
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, vjust = 1, hjust=1, size = 8),
  axis.text.y = element_text(size = 7), 
  legend.position = "bottom")

```
## Q2. ICU stays

`icustays.csv.gz` (<https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/modules/icu/icustays/>) contains data about Intensive Care Units (ICU) stays. The first 10 lines are
```{bash}
zcat < ~/mimic/icu/icustays.csv.gz | head
```

### Q2.1 Ingestion

Import `icustays.csv.gz` as a tibble `icustays_tble`. 

```{r}
icustays_tble <- read_csv("~/mimic/icu/icustays.csv.gz")
```


### Q2.2 Summary and visualization

How many unique `subject_id`? Can a `subject_id` have multiple ICU stays? Summarize the number of ICU stays per `subject_id` by graphs.

**Answer:** By running the code, we can tell that we have 50,920 unique `subject_id`,
thus we do have some `subject_id` have multiple ICU stays since the original row number
is 73,181.
```{r}
unique_subject_id <- icustays_tble %>% distinct(subject_id)
nrow(unique_subject_id)
```

```{r}
icu_summary <- icustays_tble %>%
  group_by(subject_id) %>%
  summarise(icu_stays_num = n()) %>%
  count(icu_stays_num)

ggplot(icu_summary, aes(x = icu_stays_num, y = n)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Number of ICU Stays", y = "Number of Subjects", 
       title = "Distribution of ICU Stays per Subject") +
  xlim(0, 40)
```

## Q3. `admissions` data

Information of the patients admitted into hospital is available in `admissions.csv.gz`. See <https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/modules/hosp/admissions/> for details of each field in this file. The first 10 lines are
```{bash}
zcat < ~/mimic/hosp/admissions.csv.gz | head
```

### Q3.1 Ingestion

Import `admissions.csv.gz` as a tibble `admissions_tble`.
**Answer:** The `admission.csv.gz` has already be imported as a tibble in Q1,
I will just make a copy of it and name it `admissions_tble`
```{r}
admissions_tble <- admissions
print(admissions_tble, width = Inf)
```

### Q3.2 Summary and visualization

Summarize the following information by graphics and explain any patterns you see.

- number of admissions per patient
**Answer:** We can tell that it's a extremely skewed data.
```{r}
admissions_per_patient <- admissions_tble %>%
  group_by(subject_id) %>%
  summarise(number_of_admissions = n()) %>%
  count(number_of_admissions)

ggplot(data = admissions_per_patient) + 
  geom_col(mapping = aes(x = number_of_admissions, y = n))+ 
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Number of Admissions per Patient",
       x = "Number of Admissions",
       y = "Number of Patients")
```

- admission hour (anything unusual?) 
```{r}
class(admissions_tble$admittime)
```

**Answer:** The hospital have a lot of admissions at 0 AM and 7 AM compared to 
other time slots. It's kind of unusual to me, but not sure why is this happening.
```{r}
admissions_tble <- admissions_tble %>%
  mutate("admit_hour" = hour((admittime)))

ggplot(admissions_tble) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes (x = admit_hour)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Admissions by Hour of the Day",
       x = "Hour of Admission",
       y = "Count")
```
- admission minute (anything unusual?)
```{r}
admissions_tble <- admissions_tble %>%
  mutate("admit_min" = minute((admittime)))

ggplot(admissions_tble) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes (x = admit_min)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Admissions by Minute of the Day",
       x = "Hour of Admission",
       y = "Count")
```
**Answer:** The plot showed high frequency at 0, 15, 30 and 45 minutes， possibly
due to the rounding.

- length of hospital stay (from admission to discharge) (anything unusual?)
```{r}
admissions_tble <- admissions_tble %>%
  mutate("length_stay" = round(as.numeric(difftime(admissions_tble$dischtime,
                                  admissions_tble$admittime, 
                                  units = "days"))))


ggplot(admissions_tble) +
  geom_bar(mapping = aes (x = length_stay)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Length of the Hospital Stay per Patient",
       x = "Length of Stay",
       y = "Count")
```

**Answer:** We have a lot of people with length of stay equals to 0 and -1, which
is quite unusual, not sure what was happening.

According to the [MIMIC-IV documentation](https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/about/concepts/#date-shifting), 

> All dates in the database have been shifted to protect patient confidentiality. Dates will be internally consistent for the same patient, but randomly distributed in the future. Dates of birth which occur in the present time are not true dates of birth. Furthermore, dates of birth which occur before the year 1900 occur if the patient is older than 89. In these cases, the patient’s age at their first admission has been fixed to 300.

## Q4. `patients` data

Patient information is available in `patients.csv.gz`. See <https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/modules/hosp/patients/> for details of each field in this file. The first 10 lines are
```{bash}
zcat < ~/mimic/hosp/patients.csv.gz | head
```

### Q4.1 Ingestion

Import `patients.csv.gz` (<https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/modules/hosp/patients/>) as a tibble `patients_tble`.
**Answer:** The `patients.csv.gz` has already be imported as a tibble in Q1,
I will just make a copy of it and name it `patients_tble`
```{r}
patients_tble <- patients
print(patients_tble, width = Inf)
```


### Q4.2 Summary and visualization

Summarize variables `gender` and `anchor_age` by graphics, and explain any patterns you see.

**Answer:** The first graph is the histogram showing the distribution of gender,
more females presented. The second boxplot showed the anchor distribution by gender.
Both have a similar range, whereas males have a higher median anchor age compared to females.
```{r}
ggplot(patients_tble) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = gender, fill = gender)) 

ggplot(data = patients_tble, mapping = aes(x = gender, 
                                           y = anchor_age)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + labs(title = "Anchor age by gender") +
  labs(x = "Gender", y = "Anchor age")


```

**Answer:** This graph also showed the anchor_age distribution by gender. We have
a peak at age 91. Both gender have a similar trend.
```{r}
ggplot(patients_tble) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = anchor_age, fill = gender)) + 
  labs(title = "Anchor age by gender")
```

## Q5. Lab results    

`labevents.csv.gz` (<https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/modules/hosp/labevents/>) contains all laboratory measurements for patients. The first 10 lines are
```{bash}
zcat < ~/mimic/hosp/labevents.csv.gz | head
```

`d_labitems.csv.gz` (<https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/modules/hosp/d_labitems/>) is the dictionary of lab measurements. 
```{bash}
zcat < ~/mimic/hosp/d_labitems.csv.gz | head
```

We are interested in the lab measurements of creatinine (50912), potassium (50971), sodium (50983), chloride (50902), bicarbonate (50882), hematocrit (51221), white blood cell count (51301), and glucose (50931). Retrieve a subset of `labevents.csv.gz` that only containing these items for the patients in `icustays_tble`. Further restrict to the last available measurement (by `storetime`) before the ICU stay. The final `labevents_tble` should have one row per ICU stay and columns for each lab measurement.

![](https://github.com/ucla-biostat-203b/2024winter/blob/main/hw/hw3/labevents_tble.png?raw=true)

Hint: Use the Parquet format you generated in Homework 2. For reproducibility, make `labevents_pq` folder available at the current working directory `hw3`, for example, by a symbolic link.

**Answer:** The `labevents.parquet` folder is already available at current directory
```{r}
item_ids_labs <- c(50912, 50971, 50983, 50902, 50882, 51221, 51301, 50931)
d_labitem <- read_csv("~/mimic/hosp/d_labitems.csv.gz") %>%
  filter(itemid %in% item_ids_labs) %>%
  collect()
```

```{r}
labevents_measure <- arrow::open_dataset("labevents.parquet") %>%
  select(subject_id, storetime, valuenum, itemid) %>%
  filter(itemid %in% d_labitem$itemid) %>%
  filter(subject_id %in% icustays_tble$subject_id) %>%
  collect()

```

```{r}
labevents_measure <- labevents_measure %>%
  left_join(select(icustays_tble, subject_id, stay_id, intime), 
            by = "subject_id") %>%
  filter(storetime <= intime) %>%
  group_by(subject_id, stay_id, itemid) %>%
  arrange(storetime, .by_group = TRUE) %>%
  slice_tail(n = 1) %>%
  select(-storetime, -intime)

```

```{r}
labevents_final <- labevents_measure %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = itemid, values_from = valuenum) %>%
  rename_at(
    vars(as.character(d_labitem$itemid)),
    ~str_to_lower(d_labitem$label)
  ) %>%
  print(width = Inf)

```

## Q6. Vitals from charted events

`chartevents.csv.gz` (<https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/modules/icu/chartevents/>) contains all the charted data available for a patient. During their ICU stay, the primary repository of a patient’s information is their electronic chart. The `itemid` variable indicates a single measurement type in the database. The `value` variable is the value measured for `itemid`. The first 10 lines of `chartevents.csv.gz` are
```{bash}
zcat < ~/mimic/icu/chartevents.csv.gz | head
```

`d_items.csv.gz` (<https://mimic.mit.edu/docs/iv/modules/icu/d_items/>) is the dictionary for the `itemid` in `chartevents.csv.gz`. 
```{bash}
zcat < ~/mimic/icu/d_items.csv.gz | head
```

We are interested in the vitals for ICU patients: heart rate (220045), systolic non-invasive blood pressure (220179), diastolic non-invasive blood pressure (220180), body temperature in Fahrenheit (223761), and respiratory rate (220210). Retrieve a subset of `chartevents.csv.gz` only containing these items for the patients in `icustays_tble`. Further restrict to the first vital measurement within the ICU stay. The final `chartevents_tble` should have one row per ICU stay and columns for each vital measurement. 

![](https://github.com/ucla-biostat-203b/2024winter/blob/main/hw/hw3/chartevents_tble.png?raw=true)

Hint: Use the Parquet format you generated in Homework 2. For reproducibility, make `chartevents_pq` folder available at the current working directory, for example, by a symbolic link.
**Answer:** I did not use parquet format for my charevents data in Homework 2,
so I will use `read_csv`. Also, because the `chartevents.csv.gz` is too big to be read 
in by the `read_csv` command, I will only include several variables to reduce burden.

```{r}
item_ids_vital <- c(220045, 220179, 220180, 223761, 220210)
d_vitalitem <- read_csv("~/mimic/icu/d_items.csv.gz") %>%
  filter(itemid %in% item_ids_vital) %>%
  collect()
```

```{r}
chartevents_vital <- open_dataset("chartevents.csv", format = "csv") %>%
  select(subject_id, charttime, value, itemid) %>%
  filter(itemid %in% d_vitalitem$itemid) %>%
  filter(subject_id %in% icustays_tble$subject_id) %>%
  collect()

```

```{r}
chartevents_vital <- chartevents_vital %>%
  left_join(select(icustays_tble, subject_id, stay_id, intime, outtime), 
            by = "subject_id")%>%
  filter(charttime >= intime & charttime <= outtime) %>%
  group_by(subject_id, stay_id, itemid) %>%
  arrange(charttime, .by_group = TRUE) %>%
  slice_head(n = 1)
```

```{r}
chartevents_final <- chartevents_vital %>%
  select(-charttime, -intime, -outtime) %>%
  pivot_wider(names_from = itemid, values_from = value) %>%
  rename_at(
  vars(as.character(d_vitalitem$itemid)),
  ~str_to_lower(d_vitalitem$label)
  ) %>%
  print(width = Inf)

```



## Q7. Putting things together

Let us create a tibble `mimic_icu_cohort` for all ICU stays, where rows are all ICU stays of adults (age at `intime` >= 18) and columns contain at least following variables

- all variables in `icustays_tble`  
- all variables in `admissions_tble`  
- all variables in `patients_tble`
- the last lab measurements before the ICU stay in `labevents_tble` 
- the first vital measurements during the ICU stay in `chartevents_tble`

The final `mimic_icu_cohort` should have one row per ICU stay and columns for each variable.

![](https://github.com/ucla-biostat-203b/2024winter/blob/main/hw/hw3/mimic_icu_cohort.png?raw=true)
```{r}
mimic_icu_cohort <- icustays_tble %>%
  left_join(patients_tble, by = c("subject_id")) %>%
  mutate(age_at_intime =  year(intime) + anchor_age - anchor_year) %>%
  filter(age_at_intime >= 18) %>%
  left_join(admissions_tble, by = c("subject_id", "hadm_id")) %>%
  left_join(labevents_final, by = c("subject_id", "stay_id")) %>%
  left_join(chartevents_final, by = c("subject_id", "stay_id")) %>%
  print(width = Inf)

## Q8. Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

Summarize the following information about the ICU stay cohort `mimic_icu_cohort` using appropriate numerics or graphs:

- Length of ICU stay `los` vs demographic variables (race, insurance, marital_status, gender, age at intime)

```{r}
mimic_icu_cohort <- mimic_icu_cohort %>%
  mutate(los_rounded = round(los))
```

**Answer:** White and asian seems to have a longer ICU stay on average compared
to hispanic and black.


```{r}
#race
ggplot(mimic_icu_cohort, aes(x = los, y = race)) +
  geom_point() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Race", y = "Length of ICU Stay")
```


```{r}
#insurance
ggplot(mimic_icu_cohort, aes(x = los)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) + 
  facet_wrap(~ insurance, scales = "free_x") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Length of ICU Stay", y = "Count") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) 
```


```{r}
#marital_status
ggplot(mimic_icu_cohort, aes(x = los)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1) + 
  facet_wrap(~ marital_status, scales = "fixed") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Length of ICU Stay", y = "Count") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, hjust = 1)) 

```


```{r}
#gender
ggplot(mimic_icu_cohort, aes(x = los, fill = gender)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5) + 
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Length of ICU Stay", y = "Count", fill = "Gender") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1") 

```


```{r}
#age at in time
ggplot(mimic_icu_cohort, aes(x = age_at_intime, y = los)) +
  geom_point() +  
  labs(x = "Age", y = "Length of ICU Stay")
```

- Length of ICU stay `los` vs the last available lab measurements before ICU stay
```{r}
long_data_lab <- mimic_icu_cohort %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = 30:37, names_to = "variable", values_to = "value")

ggplot(long_data_lab, aes(x = los)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 1, color = "black") + 
  facet_wrap(~ variable, scales = "free") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Length of ICU Stay", y = "Count") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5)) 
```

- Length of ICU stay `los` vs the first vital measurements within the ICU stay
```{r}
mimic_icu_cohort <- mimic_icu_cohort %>%
  mutate(across(.cols = 38:42, .fns = as.numeric))

long_data_vital <- mimic_icu_cohort %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = 38:42, names_to = "variable", 
               values_to = "value")

ggplot(long_data_vital, aes(x = los)) +
  geom_histogram(color = "black") + 
  facet_wrap(~ variable, scales = "free") +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Length of ICU Stay", y = "Count") +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5)) 
```

- Length of ICU stay `los` vs first ICU unit
```{r}
ggplot(mimic_icu_cohort, aes(x = los, fill = first_careunit)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5) + 
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(x = "Length of ICU Stay", y = "Count", fill = "unit") +
  scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Set1")
